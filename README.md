A student-project creating a Sequential Binary Circuit calculator.

### Contents:

- [home.html](home.html) - Contains the html file of the program.
- [index.js](index.js) - Contains the javscript of the program.
- [style.css](style.css) - Contains the style sheet of the program.

### Instructions:

- Inputs SHOULD BE in binary.
  - Uses minimum number of bits.
  - Max up to 16-bit.
- Output has an option to choose whether to show _step-by-step_ or _all_.
  - Step-by-step
    - Once this is clicked, the user should finish showing the output in order to be able to input a new value for **multiplicand** and/or **multiplier**.
    - If the user suddenly updated the input fields the user should click the show _step-by-step_ button. Otherwise, if the user clicked the _next step_ it would still show the next step of the previous input.
  - All
    - This shows the whole output.
  - Clear
    - This clears the inputs and the solutions.
- Have fun and enjoy.
